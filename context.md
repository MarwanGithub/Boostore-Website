This project is about a small bookstore that presents books to the users. The books should be added by an admin from an admin panel. Books have categories and will belong to a category. For now only the admin panel will require a log in and we will use the django admin for this.

note we are using render as a free hosting platform. we want to keep things free for this project. also importantly note that this project is going to handle maybe max 5 users per day and usually 3 only so not much traffic
