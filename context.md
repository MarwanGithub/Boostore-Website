This project is about a small bookstore that presents books to the users. The books should be added by an admin from an admin panel. Books have categories and will belong to a category. For now only the admin panel will require a log in and we will use the django admin for this.

Categories should be represented by an adjacency list because there are subcategories like philosophy that has sub category of science philosophy.. etc.
